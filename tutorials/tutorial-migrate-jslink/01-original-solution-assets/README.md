# Tutorial: Migrating from JSLink to SharePoint Framework Extensions

Original "classic" assets to apply _JSLink_ customization to a list view of a custom list.

![The "classic" custom footer in action](../images/jslink-field-output.png)

In this folder you can find:
- Custom JavaScript file to use as the source for the _JSLink_ property of a list view web part.
- Custom PnP provisioning template that you can apply on a "classic" site to test the custom _JSLink_ functionality against a custom list with title "Custom List with Colors".
